# Bus Ticket Booking Website
## Abstract:

This project presents a static website for bus ticket booking. The website provides a user-friendly interface for customers to browse available bus routes, select their desired travel dates and times, and book their tickets. The website is designed to be visually appealing and easy to navigate, providing a seamless booking experience for customers. While the website does not currently have a backend, it serves as a proof-of-concept for a fully functional bus ticket booking system.
